    "### Why event-based pacing\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most common pacing methods used in cardiac cell simulation are (1) a periodic brief block current, or stimulus, and (2) a series of voltage steps.\n",
    "Both cases fit neatly into the event-based scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "These protocols could also be implemented as part of the model - conceptually, they are outside the cell and therefore outside the model, but then again, so are the physical constants and external concentrations frequently included in cell models.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a typical stimulus current is a 0.5ms pulse given once every 1000ms.\n",
    "For an efficient, variable step-size solver, this means there is a very large chance the solver will step over the stimulus completely.\n",
    "A simple way to remedy this is to limit the maximum step size to less than 0.5ms, but (1) this requires the solver to know about the protocol and (2) this degrades the efficiency of the variable step-size scheme, especially in the diastolic phases where step sizes can easily exceed 100ms.\n",
    "A much more efficient way to fix it is to tell the solver where the discontinuities are, so that it can ensure it doesn't step over them.\n",
    "This is what the event-based protocol achieves."

    "## Fixed-form pacing\n",
    "\n",
    "In real experiments, an \"AP-clamp\" or \"data-clamp\" protocol is sometimes employed during which a pre-calculated time-series signal is applied to the cell, either as a current or a voltage (see e.g. [Bebarova, 2012](https://doi.org/10.4149/gpb_2012_016)).\n",
    "In Myokit single-cell simulations, there are several ways to achieve something similar:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For piecewise constant signals, use the event-based pacing protocol. This is the most efficient method.\n",
    "- For sinusoidal or other time-dependent, continuous signals, add equations to the model.\n",
    "- For signals with a piecewise constant part and a more complicated part, split the simulation into two or more parts.\n",
    "- If there is no other option, use the _fixed-form pacing_ capabilities of the `Simulation` class.\n",
    " \n",
    "Fixed-form pacing allows you to specify a time series as a tuple $(\\{t_0, t_1, ... , t_{n}\\}, \\{x_0, x_1, ... x_{n}\\})$ where $t_i$ is a point in time and $x_i$ is the corresponding pacing value.\n",
    "The times array may contain duplicates, but must be strictly non-decreasing.\n",
    "At any time $t$, the value of the pacing variable $x$ is then defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Searching for indices $i$ and $i+1$ such that $t_i \\leq t < t_{i+1}$.\n",
    "- If such an interval can be found, the value is calculated from values $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$ using linear interpolation.\n",
    "- If the requested time is earlier than $t_0$, the value $x_0$ is used.\n",
    "- If the requested time is later than $t_n$, the value $x_n$ is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using bisection search, this can be implemented quickly.\n",
    "However, (1) the interpolation is still only an approximation of the \"true\" value of whatever process generated the time series.\n",
    "And (2), the interpolated function is not smooth: its derivatives may be discontinuities at any point $(t_i, x_i)$."

    "In the absence of a pacing protocol (event-based _or_ fixed-form) the pacing variable will have value $0$.\n",

    "An alternative idea was to have the pacing variable be undefined.\n",
    "In this case, any variables bound to the pacing variable would become unbound and retain their original, user-specified value.\n",
    "_However,_ this would allow variables to change from bound to unbound without (A) changes to the model or (B) a change in simulation engine.\n",
