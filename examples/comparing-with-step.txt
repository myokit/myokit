# Comparing models with step

## Basics: Look at derivatives

Catches:
- make sure state doesn't have zeros or other "boring" numbers
- make sure you try several model "modes"


## Compare against reference output

With initial state from file
With derivatives from file

## Compare against reference model

(When modifying a file)

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import myokit

m1 = myokit.load_model('ni-2017-units.mmt')
m2 = myokit.load_model('ni-2017.mmt')

state = [0.01 if x == 0 else x for x in m2.state()]

print(myokit.step(m1, initial=state, reference=m2))
```
