class Protocol(object):
    """
    Represents a pacing protocol as a sequence of :class:`events
    <ProtocolEvent>`.

    Every event represents a time span during which the stimulus is non-zero.
    All events specify a stimulus level, a starting time and a duration. The
    stimulus level is given as a dimensionless number where 0 is no stimulus
    and 1 is a "full" stimulus. No range is specified: 2 would indicate "twice
    the normal stimulus".

    Periodic events can be created by specifying their period. A period of 0 is
    used for non-periodic events. The number of times a periodic event occurs
    can be set using the `multiplier` value. For any non-zero value, the event
    will occur exactly this many times.

    If an event starts while another event is already active, the new event
    will determine the pacing value and the old event will be deactivated.

    Scheduling two events to occur at the same time will result in an error, as
    the resulting behavior would be undefined. When events are scheduled with
    the same starting time an error will be raised immediately. If the clash
    only happens when an event re-occurs, an error will be raised when using
    the protocol (for example during a simulation).

    An event with start time ``a`` and duration ``b`` will be active during
    the interval ``[a, b)``. In other words, time ``a`` will be the first time
    it is active and time ``b`` will be the first time after ``a`` at which it
    is not.
