class JacobianTracer(myokit.CppModule):
    """
    Given a model and a simulation log, this class can revisit every logged
    point and generate the corresponding Jacobian.

    When created, a ``JacobianTracer`` will generate and compile a back-end
    that uses automatic differentiation to evaluate the partial derivatives of
    the model's right-hand side function at any given point in time.

    For a model::

        dx/dt = f(x, t, i)

    with state x, time t and inputs i, the class will generate the partial
    derivatives of each component of f with respect to each component of x.

    Methods to calculate eigenvalues and isolate dominant eigenvalues are
    provided.

    N.B. The partial derivatives can not be calculated for the following
    functions: ``floor``, ``ceil``, ``abs``, quotients and remainders. If these
    are encountered the resulting derivatives will be yielded as ``NaN``.
    However, in many cases, these functions will only occur as part of a
    condition in an if statement, so the ``NaN``'s won't propagate to the final
    result.
