    Benchmarks a model's right hand side (rhs).

    To enable partial benchmarking the argument ``variables`` can be used to
    pass in a list of variables whose combined evaluation time can be obtained
    by using :meth:`bench_part()`. Only non-constant, non-bound variables can
    be selected.

    By default, the given list of variables are the only variables included in
    a partial simulation. This behaviour can be inverted by setting
    ``exclude_selected=True``. With this setting, all variables except those in
    the given list will be tested.

    A valid myokit model should be provided as the ``model`` argument.
