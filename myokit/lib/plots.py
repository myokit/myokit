    """
    Draws a graph of step sizes used during a simulation.

    Data can be passed in as ``time`` (simulation time) ``realtime``
    (benchmarked time during the simulation) and ``evaluations`` (the number
    of evaluations needed for each step). Which of these fields are required
    dependens on the chosen plot ``mode``:

    ``stair``
        Draws ``time`` on the x-axis, and the step number on the y-axis.
        In this plot, a high slope means the integrator is taking lots of
        steps.
    ``stair_inverse``
        Draws ``time`` on the y-axis, and the step number on the x-axis.
    ``load``
        Draws ``time`` on the x-axis, and log(1 / step size) on the y-axis.
        In this plot, high values on the y-axis should be found near difficult
        times on the x-axis
    ``histo``
        Lumps ``time`` into buckets (whose number can be specified using the
        argument ``nbuckets``) and counts the number of steps in each bucket.
        In the final result, the times corresponding to the buckets are plotted
        on the x axis and the number of evaluations in each bucket is plotted
        on the y axis.
    ``time_per_step``
        Uses the ``realtime`` argument to calculate the time taken to advance
        the solution each step.
        In the resulting plot, the step count is plotted on the x-axis, while
        the y-axis shows the time spent at this point.
    ``eval_per_step``
        Uses the ``evaluations`` entry to calculate the number of rhs
        evaluations required for each step.
        In the resulting plot, the step number is plotted on the x-axis, and
        the number of rhs evaluations for each step is plotted on the y-axis.

    The argument ``axes`` can be used to pass in a matplotlib axes object to be
    used for the plot. If none are given, the current axes obtained from
    ``pyplot.gca()`` are used.

    Returns a matplotlib axes object.

    Plots a number of currents, one on top of the other, with the positive and
    negative parts of the current plotted separately.

    The advantage of this type of plot is that it shows the relative size of
    each current versus the others, and gives an indication of the total
    positive and negative current in a model.

    Accepts the following arguments:

    ``log``
        A:class:`myokit.DataLog` containing all the data to plot.
    ``currents``
        A list of keys, where each key corresponds to a current stored in
        ``log``.
    ``axes``
        The matplotlib axes to create the plot on.
    ``labels``
        Can be used to pass in a list containing the label to set for each
        current.
    ``colors``
        Can be used to pass in a list containing the colors to set for each
        current.
    ``integrate``
        Set this to ``True`` to plot total carried charge instead of currents.
    ``normalize``
        Set this to ``True`` to normalize the graph at every point, so that the
        relative contribution of each current is shown.
    ``max_currents``
        Set this to any integer n to display only the first n currents, and
        group the rest together in a remainder current.
    ``line_args``
        An optional dict with keyword arguments to pass in when drawing lines.
    ``fill_args``
        An optional dict with keyword arguments to pass in when drawing shaded
        areas.

    The best results are obtained if relatively constant currents are specified
    early. Another rule of thumb is to specify the currents roughly in the
    order they appear during an AP.
