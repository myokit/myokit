  - [#581](https://github.com/MichaelClerx/myokit/pull/581) The method `Expression.depends_on` now has an argument `deep` that can be set to `True` to perform a recursive dependency check.
  - [#595](https://github.com/MichaelClerx/myokit/pull/595) A class `myokit.CModel` was added that can generate multi-purpose C code for use in simulations. This is mainly for internal use.

  - [#735](https://github.com/MichaelClerx/myokit/pull/735) The new module `myokit.float` contains several functions related to floating point numbers that were previously in the main `myokit` namespace or not part of the public API.
  - [#735](https://github.com/MichaelClerx/myokit/pull/735) The new module `myokit.tools` contains several stand-alone tools that are used by Myokit and were previously in the main `myokit` namespace or not part of the public API.
