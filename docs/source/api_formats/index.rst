.. module:: myokit.formats

*This page is about importing from and exporting to formats other than*
``mmt``. *If you are interested in the* ``mmt`` *format, please look at the
section* :ref:`api/io`.

One of the main goals of myokit is to provide :ref:`export <api/export>` of
Simulations to other formats (for example C or matlab). To provide a uniform
interface to these functions the :class:`Exporter` class is defined. Import
from other formats is provided through the :class:`Importer` interface.

Exporters to exchange or presentation formats will typically export a bare
model definition, while exporters to programming languages mostly create a full
Simulation including pacing, a simulation engine and even some post processing.

The goal of an :class:`Importer` is to produce a ``(model, protocol, script)``
tuple containing the three main parts of an ``mmt`` file. However, most
importers will only provide a model definition so the remaining entries in the
tuple will be ``None``.

The methods used to import and export programmatically are described below, and
and some example code is given.

The following formats are currently supported:

..  toctree::
    :titlesonly:
    :maxdepth: 1
    :glob:

    ./*

Example
=======
To find out which kinds of import/export are available, the methods
:func:`exporters()` and :func:`importers()` are defined. These
functions return a list of names that can be passed to
:func:`exporter()` or :func:`importer` to obtain the class name
of the requested im- or exporter. This is returned as a ``type`` object, from
which instances can then be constructed::

    import myokit
    from myokit import formats

    # Load a (model, protocol, script) tuple
    m, p, s = myokit.load('example.mmt')

    # Create a simulation
    s = myokit.Simulation(m, p)

    # Create an Ansi-C exporter
    e = formats.exporter('ansic')

    # Get some info about this exporter
    print e.info()

    # Export to the directory /home/michael/test
    # If this directory does not exist, the exporter will attempt to create it.
    e.export_simulation(s, '/home/michael/test')

Expression writers
==================

A number of export classes use :class:`ExpressionWriter` objects to convert
myokit expressions to string representations in the appropriate language. The
base class for expression writers is described below:

.. autofunction:: ewriter

.. autofunction:: ewriters

.. autoclass:: ExpressionWriter
    :private-members:

Registering external formats
============================

The importers, exporters, and expression writers that are packed with Myokit
are automatically detected at start-up. To register classes defined outside of
the ``myokit`` module, use the functions below. After registering, you can
obtain e.g. an :class:`Exporter` via
``myokit.formats.exporter(my_external_exporter)``.

.. autofunction:: register_external_importer

.. autofunction:: register_external_exporter

.. autofunction:: register_external_ewriter

Default expression writers
==========================

Finally, Myokit contains two default expression writers, which are used
internally to write expressions in Python format with or without NumPy support.

.. currentmodule:: myokit

.. autofunction:: python_writer

.. autofunction:: numpy_writer

Data formats
============

In addition to model and protocol formats, Myokit can read some
electrophysiology formats. Support for advanced features is usually not
implemented, but basic access is provided to ABF, WCP and HEKA files.
Classes for these three formats share a common API, and make use of the
:class`SweepSource` class shown below.

.. currentmodule:: myokit.formats

.. autoclass:: SweepSource
