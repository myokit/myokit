[Myokit](http://myokit.org) is a tool for modeling and simulation of cardiac cellular electrophysiology.
It's [open-source](https://github.com/myokit/myokit/blob/main/LICENSE.txt), written in Python, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/myokit/myokit/) and available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/myokit/).
For the latest documentation, see [myokit.readthedocs.io](https://myokit.readthedocs.io/).

More information, including examples and an installation guide, is available on [myokit.org](http://myokit.org).
A list of changes introduced in each Myokit release is provided in the [Changelog](https://github.com/myokit/myokit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).


## Install

For full installation details (on linux, mac, or windows), please see [http://myokit.org/install](http://myokit.org/install).
A shorter installation guide for experienced users is given below.

To install Myokit, using PyQt5 for Myokit's GUI components, run:

    pip install myokit[pyqt]
    
to use PySide2 instead, run:
    
    pip install myokit[pyside]
    
If you're not planning to use the GUI components (for example to run simulations on a server), you can simply install with

    pip install myokit

On Linux and Windows, start menu icons can be added by running

    python -m myokit icons

To run single-cell simulations, [CVODES](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software) must be installed (but Windows users can skip this step, as binaries are included in the pip install).
In addition, Myokit needs a working C/C++ compiler to be present on the system.

Existing Myokit installations can be upgraded using

    pip install --upgrade myokit


## Quick-start guide

After installation, to quickly test if Myokit works, type

    python -m myokit run example
    
or simply

    myokit run example
    
To open an IDE window, type

    myokit ide

To see what else Myokit can do, type

    myokit -h
    

## Contributing to Myokit

New features are best discussed in an issue before starting any implementation work, and guidelines for code style (and more) can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/myokit/myokit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Citing Myokit

If you use Myokit in your research, please cite it using the information in our [CITATION file](https://github.com/myokit/myokit/blob/main/CITATION).

I like to [keep track of who's using Myokit](http://myokit.org/publications/) (for my CV!). If you are using Myokit for teaching, I'd love to hear about it. You can drop me a line at michael[at]myokit.org.
